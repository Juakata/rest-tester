# README
This project is from the microverse curriculum using The Odin Project
The goal was to use the rest-client to learn about using GET and POST

To run the project first clone the repo.
Navigate to the project folder and first run rails server
then run the file using
ruby app/script/rest_requestor.rb

In it's current state it will give error 422 for the post method
since it's being run in the command line
